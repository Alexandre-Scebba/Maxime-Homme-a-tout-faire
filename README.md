This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Environment Variables

The contact form uses EmailJS and requires three environment variables to be set for it to work in development and production. Add these to a `.env.local` file in the project root (do NOT commit secrets to source control):

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID=your_emailjs_service_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID=your_emailjs_template_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_EMAILJS_PUBLIC_KEY=your_emailjs_public_key
```

- These variables are read in the client by the contact form component and must be available at build time.
- Restart the dev server after adding or changing `.env.local`.

If the variables are not set, the contact form will not send messages. For security, do not store private server-only secrets with the NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix; these are intended for public client-side usage as required by EmailJS.
